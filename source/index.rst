Welcome to PinTheOrgan!
=======================

This is a non-commercial educational game aimed at teaching about organs,
where they are and somewhat their relative size. It uses organ cutouts by `adventure-in-a-box <https://www.adventure-in-a-box.com>`_.
It was originally delivered as an educational activity stall at the BREATHE `Bloomsbury Festival <https://bloomsburyfestival.org.uk/>`_ 2022, delivered by the `Satsuma Lab <https://satsuma.cs.ucl.ac.uk>`_, part of the `Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/>`_ from `University College London (UCL) <https://www.ucl.ac.uk>`_.


This documentation explains how to run the game, see :doc:`activity` and if you don't have the cutouts ready to :doc:`setup` the game.
