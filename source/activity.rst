  * Can make this trickier by requiring organs be the right way up too. i.e. small Intestine.

Timed Competition
-----------------

For those that are more competitive.

* Time participants to pin up all the organs.
* Apply a penalty for incorrect placement.
* Using another sheet of parcel paper stuck up to the wall to list names and times.

.. tip::
  * You can also do this alongside a :ref:`race`.
